		<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
	
	<p>I am (presently) a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. My interests are in combinatorics,
	probability, and algorithms. I'm leaving that as broad as possible, since my interests are pretty broad. (Probably I'll edit this later on).
		
	Terrence Tao recommends [writing stuff down](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/) and then making it 
	[publically available](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/make-your-work-available/) once you've written it down. This is my
	attempt to follow that advice. While he seems to be catering towards original ideas in research, the best I can do is just write down my
	personal ideas - maybe some will be original.
		
	For the most part, this is a blog. Many blog posts will be more technical in nature, but I want to branch out and talk about non-technical
	things as well. Maybe I'll review a book. We'll see. In any case, I hope you enjoy the blog.</p>
